# macro

This is a sample macro written specifically to analyze attendance files generated from the Blackboard system.
The new workbook generated consists of two worksheets.Â 
One with a full attendance report, of which column 2 shows the attendance rate for each student.
The second sheet displays the individual attendance report.
The macro also includes a form that is displayed when the analysis is going on, so that the user knows the progress.
